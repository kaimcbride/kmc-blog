### This is the internet home of photographer Kai McBride. 

Please jump right to [Albums](/albums/) if you want to see photographs organized by project, or [About](/about/) if
you want to download my C.V. and read a short bio. I'm also making some blog-like [Posts](/posts/) from time to time. If you feel like reaching
out, go to [Contact](/contact/). I teach photography classes for [StrudelmediaLive](https://strudelmedialive.com/teachers/mcbride).

I also post to my [Blue Sky
Account](https://bsky.app/profile/kaimcbride.com). Enjoy!
