Kai McBride is a photographer, musician, teacher, and cyclist who recently uprooted from Brooklyn to sunny Santa Fe, New Mexico. He spent ten years teaching photography and managing the photo facilities at Columbia University, his alma mater, where he received an MFA in 2008.

Born on the island of Kauai in 1972, by his 18th birthday Kai had lived in California, Oregon, Mississippi, Wisconsin, Texas, Oahu, North Carolina, and Massachusetts. He sharpened his powers of observation while adjusting to life between suburban ranch-style homes, cabins with no running water, and a twenty foot teepee in the field of a commune.

In 2021, Kai and his girlfriend (Corn Wagon Thunder) finished creating a small off-grid cabin on a mesa east of downtown Santa Fe. Solar power. Captured rainwater. Built with their own two hands. In 2025, they completed building a small art studio building on the property.
