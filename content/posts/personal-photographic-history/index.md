### From Childhood Camera to Master's Degree
{{< figure src="featured.jpg" >}}
<ul>
<li><b>First Grade,</b><i> Ashland OR, </i>get my first camera, cartridge point
and shoot. Take "action" shots of my friend and I doing wheelies on our
bicycles. Ride my bicycle about a 1/2 mile away to drop off the film and pick
it up- it never comes back from the lab fast enough.

<li><b>Third Grade,</b><i> Austin TX,</i> my half-sister Bridgette shows me
some black and white contact sheets of 35mm self-portraits, the first I'd ever
seen. They look beautiful and mysterious.

<li><b>Sixth Grade,</b><i> Honolulu HA,</i> take a lot of pictures of my friend
Nashringa. Some action shots where it's supposed to look like he's being 
attacked by a man-eating bush. Start experimenting with applying bleach to the surface of the prints
which causes them to fade to yellow and then bleach to white. A lot of images
where everyone's head is replaced by a 
glowing bleached-out ball

<li><b>Eighth Grade,</b><i> Highlands NC,</i> meet up with my sister Bridgette again,
see the photo work she'd been doing over the last couple years&mdash; i'm
impressed. Remember an image she had of bubbles floating in the air. I start a
series of photos where i put the camera on the ground in tall grass and weeds,
trying to make them look like tall trees in a strange forest&mdash; most are
out of focus&mdash; little "tip" stickers from the photolab advise me to not
get so close.

<li><b>Twelfth Grade (1990),</b><i> North Carolina School of the Arts,
Winston-Salem NC,</i> during my second year I get an A in Art History and
qualify,  along with a few others, to take a two month photo class. Already
awakened artisticaly after a year and a half at NCSA, this class comes along at
the perfect time. Although I had enjoyed my other classes, this was the first
time I felt completely involved. I roamed the streets and paths of
Winston-Salem looking for material. Many portraits of friends, and innumerable
self-portraits. An image from my first roll of film, a high-contrast wet leaf I
found on the floor of an abandoned garage, won a competition prize among area
high school students. My Senior Thesis incorporates self-portraits, and I start
looking for schools with little structure and a good photography and film
department.
<li><b>Summer 1990,</b><i> Lenoir NC,</i> spending the night at Rachel, Liza,
and Jesse's house in Happy Valley the day before Rachel and I drive up to
Boston to attend the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. That evening I use
their darkroom for the first time.

<li><b>1990&mdash;1992,</b><i> SMFA Boston MA,</i> taking a mix of film and
photography classes. Spend most of my time experimenting with different
techniques, not on creating any specific body of work. Take color classes my
2nd year, don't fall for it. Work study job at the photo stockroom, which I
really enjoy.

<li><b>Summer 1992&mdash;Fall 1993,</b><i>Boston MA</i> drop out of the Museum
School (too expensive) and after a circuitous series of events wind up working
at the Museum School as the Weekend Stockroom Manager. The job is only 3 days a
week, 19hrs total, paying $8.50 an hour. My good friend Jyl Kelley is the
manager and we have a great year together. During the slow hours, particularly
Saturday mornings, I teach myself about all of the equipment and read all of
the technical books I can get my hands on. I learn more about photography
during this year than I had the previous two. Start using an old wooden 8x10
Ansco camera that no one else ever used. Couldn't afford 8x10 film, so I use
photopaper as a negative instead, later printing through it to make a positive
image. Jim Dow, photo faculty,  lends me one of his 8x10 Deardorff cameras for
the summer so that I can copy the design to build my own. I fall in love with
the Deardorff. 

<li><b>Fall 1993,</b><i> Boston MA,</i> Carl Sesto, photo and offset printing
faculty, tells me he has an old aquaintence who's starting up a new business
using computers to print fine-art photographs on water color paper. They need
someone to scan negatives and make prints and he recommended me.

<li><b>October 1993,</b><i> Medford MA,</i> after two interviews I have the
job. Company is called New American Platinotype Company, NAPC. Founded by
Robert J. Steinberg, photographer and co-founder with his wife Sura of Palladio
makers of machine coated Platinum/Palladium photo paper. The territory is new,
there are only 2 or 3 other people trying to use these large IRIS inkjet
printers to produce quality prints on nice paper. We have to make up all of the
rules ourselves through hours of experimentation. We work 6 and sometimes 7
days a week, 14 and 16hr days. During this time I fine tune my printing eye for
contrast, tone, color, etc... After a year we are in good shape, the images
look great, but unfortunately the process is just too expensive for anyone to
pay for, the company changes focus to selling our knowledge of the computers
and the printers. But before we stopped doing the prints I had the opportunity
to work on many great images, including work by Sally Mann and Cindy Sherman,
Time Covers by Gregory Heisler, and many others. 

<li><b>October 1993 &mdash; October 1997,</b> one of the main benefits of
working at NAPC is access to the printer, ink, and paper for personal work.
Often after an 80 hour week I'd come in on Sunday to print my own work all day.
crazy. This was a great period for me creatively, and I developed my person
style/aesthetic during these years. Everyone at NAPC and Palladio was a great
influence as well. Rob and Sura's house is a gallery and library combined, with
Rob's prints everywhere and a plethora of good photo books to browse. During
our trips to New York we'd meet up with Rob's friends and see some great work.
One highlight was drinking Sake with Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler, and Rob
over dinner in SoHo.

<li><b>1994 Photographica,</b><i> Boston
MA,</i> went with Rob to the Photographica show with money in my pocket and my
eye set on buying a nice 4x5 camera. Tired of shooting 35mm, and longing for
that larger negative. My dream was to find a Deardorff, but they are rare to
find and often very expensive&mdash;so I was set to get anything that I could
use. Barely had we walked in the door before Rob recognised someone at one of
the booths and they had a beautiful 
1936 5x7 Deardorff with a 5x7 and 4x5 back. Since they knew
Rob, and had met me once before, they sold it to me for $500.00. I found a lens
from another associate for $250 and I was on cloud nine. This became my main
camera for years. I dragged it all over New England, North Carolina, and
even once to the top of the Sigesaulle in Berlin. 

<li><b>1997&mdash;2000,</b><i> Hibernation,</i> After leaving NAPC I went to
work for TechSquare, a computer consulting company. Deprived of my dear Iris
printer, and the peers of NAPC, my camera gathered dust. It seemed too hard to
try and get a darkroom space together. I turned attention more to music.

<li><b>September 2000,</b><i> Brooklyn NY,</i> moved away from Boston after ten
years. Working part-time remotely for TechSquare. Wanted more time for
photography and music.

<li><b>November 2000 to November 2001,</b><i>  Brooklyn NY,</i> the
pencamProjekt is born. Wanting to help retrain my eye, and get back into the
rhythm of taking pictures, I start a semi-daily photo journal using a cheap
lo-res digital camera. The project is a huge personal success, generating 2411
images that document a very important year of my life.

<li><b>Summer 2001,</b><i> Lenoir NC,</i> living in Lenoir with Rachel for the
summer. I once again have access to their darkroom, and the time (if not
money) to start working with my Deardorff again. It's instant love from the first negatives that are
processed. I also fall in love with downtown Lenoir and spend many a hot day
walking all over setting up my camera. I become a regular and recognisable site
on the old main street. When we leave at the beginning of September I have a
nice portfolio of work, dry mounted and ready for presentation, to take with me.

<li><b>October 2001,</b><i> New York City,</i> in the aftermath of 9/11 the economy is gone in NY. Can't
afford to stay. I return to Boston and TechSquare. I find out that my
photograph Burns Oil from Lenoir has won 2nd place for B&W photo from 
Caldwell County Arts Council's
"Snapshots of Lenoir" competition and show. $50.00 prize, which I
desperately needed at that point in time.

<li><b>February 2002,</b><i> Boston MA,</i> living in the South End on Tremont
Street. Purchased, trays, beakers and chemicals, and converted my bathroom into
a place where I can at least process film. In the meantime I've been shooting
Poloroid Type 55 film which produces a 4x5 print and negative at the same time.
I scan these negatives to have a look a the image before trying to make a
print. 

<li><b>April 2002,</b><i> Boston MA,</i> Purchase Pentax Digital Spotmeter at
E.P. Levine (where I bought my Gossen Luna Star 10 yrs previous). I love this meter.
Purchase new sturdier Bogen Tripod from SBI Sales in Harvard Square.

<li><b>May 2002,</b><i> Carmel CA,</i> Attend a
workshop given by Kim, Gina, and Cole
Weston. Primarily as a pilgrimage to where Edward Weston lived. Saw his house,
darkroom, held some of his negatives, and won a print by raffle that Kim
printed. Bonus: Kim and Gina are wonderful people and excellent hosts. Leave
with my photography batteries fully charged.

<li><b>June 2002,</b><i> eBay,</i> After 8 years with my Deardorff I finally
purchase a second lens. Found a 360mm Rodenstock Sironar-N on eBay for only $580.00. It's a
true beauty.

<li><b>May 2002</b><i> Asheville NC,</i> Bought a great house in Asheville.
Moving down there in September. Already have the darkroom planned on paper. My
expenses will be very low there, and I plan on concentrating on music and my
photography.

<li><b>October 2002</b><i> Asheville, NC,</i> Begin construction on the
darkroom. Turns out to be a larger project than I initially anticipated.
Started with building my own sink out of wood. Many adventures with plumbing
under the house, building walls, hanging doors, designing my own safelights,
and making the room light tight follow.

<li><b>November 2002</b><i> Asheville, NC,</i> Purchase a used enlarger and
misc. darkroom equipment from a listing in the IWanna. Now I have a good light
source for contact printing, and enlarging my medium format negatives.

<li><b>December 27th 2002</b><i> Asheville, NC,</i> Process my first batch of
5x7 negatives in the new darkroom. Negatives taken in Louisiana while visiting
my grandfather. They look great. Darkroom is officially open for business.

<li><b>February 1st 2003</b><i> Asheville, NC,</i> Made first contact prints of
5x7 negatives in the new darkroom.

<li><b>February 14th 2003</b><i> Asheville, NC,</i> Feeling the desire to
enlarge my 5x7 negatives, not just make contact prints, I decide to look for a
cheap 5x7 enlarger. Luck is with me and there is an old Elwood available on
eBay. I get the winning bid for $280. It weighs about 45kg (~100lbs), and the
total cost with shipping is $377.

<li><b>Fall 2003</b><i> Asheville, NC,</i> Someone emails me out of the blue
from having perused this website and tells me they have an Omega E5 Enlarger.
This is a newer design than the Elwood and features a cold head. I have
concerns about the reliability of the Elwood, so I buy this enlarger too.
Unfortunately, I'm having problems getting even light distributed across
negative. Many experiments later it now looks like I need higher wattage
flourescent bulbs on the two ends. Have not yet found these.

<li><b>February 2004</b><i> Brooklyn, NY,</i> Moved back to NYC. Through
contacts at Cooper Union I wind up photographing eleven buildings for the 4th
edition of the New York City Landmarks book. A project that takes me all over
the city to neighborhoods I'd never seen. A bit of a grind since I only have a
month to take all the photographs and get prints done, while simultaneously
getting used to being back in NYC, a new job, and cold winter weather.

<li><b>March 2004</b><i> Brooklyn, NY,</i> Move back to Williamsburg, same
building as before. No darkroom access again. Alas. Start shooting Polaroid
Type 55 film again to compensate. Enjoying roaming the streets of W'burg.

<li><b>April 28th 2004</b><i> Brooklyn, NY,</i> Purchase a Vivitar 285HV Flash.
I'd been resisting the use of flash since the beginning. Laura Napier brought home some
strobes one evening and made me a believer. Hoping to have some fun with this.

<li><b>May 6th 2004</b><i> Brooklyn, NY,</i> Purchase a beautiful Nikkor 120mm f8 SuperWide Copal 0 Lens to
use on the Deardorff. One of the few 120mm lenses I found that had coverage for
5x7. My first purchase of a brand new lens. A bargain at Adorama for $989. Reuben Cox provides a nice
piece of mahogany that I use to make the lens board.

<li><b>May 15th 2004</b><i> Brooklyn, NY,</i> Finally, a darkroom. I found a
rental on craigslist for just $100 a month flat fee. Nice little place up in
Hell's Kitchen that has been there for a while. I share it with 5 other people,
but we each get to use it one at a time&mdash;so no sharing. Such a deal.
Unfortunately, there is only a 4x5 enlarger. What's a 5x7 guy to do ? I think
on my upcoming trip to Berlin I'm going to shoot Type 55. It's just so nice to
make enlargements. 

<li><b>May 27th 2004</b><i> Brooklyn, NY,</i> Felt like I needed a medium
format roll film camera (well okay I have the Rolleiflex but it's shutter is on
the blink again). I liked the idea of getting a 6x7 or 6x9 format. Found a
1950's era Voigtlander Bessa II at Pacific Rim Camera. It's in the mail to me.
Can't wait ! The major advantage of this camera is it's compact size. This is a
folding camera, so you can get a 6x9 negative from a camera that fits in your
pocket. However, after taking several test rolls and using the camera handheld
and on a tripod I determine that they just aren't sharp enough. Return both
models I bought. Sigh.

<li><b>June 2004</b><i> Berlin, Germany,</i> I travelled for two weeks in
Berlin, bringing along my Deardorff camera, 120mm lens, and 80 sheets of 4x5
Polaroid Type55 film. My goal was to shoot all 80 sheets, which I did. I
processed the last sheet at 1:02am on the night before I left. 

<li><b>June 26th 2004</b><i> Annandale-On-Hudson, NY,</i> Visit Bard College
during their summer Graduate program. Intrigued by the program. Hear about
Stephen Shore's Master Class.

<li><b>July 3rd 2004</b><i> Brooklyn, NY,</i> Decided that what I really needed
was not a fancier roll film camera, but a 'better' large format camera.
something tighter with more movements....and 4x5. Spend a week or two pouring
over photo.net and large format articles and finally decide upon a K.B. Canham
DLC45. This is an all metal camera which is light and compact. The biggest
selling feature was the seemingly unlimited movements.

<li><b>August 31st 2004</b><i> Annandale-On-Hudson, NY,</i> Meet with Stephen
Shore. Show him prints of my Berlin photographs. He accepts me into his Master
Class program. I get to meet with him every 6 weeks or so, or whenever I have
new work I'd like him to look at. Extremely excited to be working with him. It
also helps inspire me to make more work so that I have something to show.

<li><b>Nov 2004</b><i> Brooklyn, NY,</i> Moved into a new loft space with Ben
Maloway that has amazing 8 1/2 foot high bank of windows. I start a new still
life project revisiting the Suspension series that I had worked on earlier in
B&W I start a new Color Suspensions series.

<li><b>April 2005</b><i> Istanbul & Safranbolu, Turkey,</i> Fly to Turkey to
visit Rachel and see the country for the first time. Blown away. Shoot about 40
sheets of color 4x5 with the new DLC45&mdash;its first trip abroad. Definitely
want to spend more time there. Barely scratched the surface of Istanbul. 

<li><b>May 9th 2005</b><i> Brooklyn, NY,</i> Okay, I'm on a buying binge. After
a lot of internal debate I decide that I'm ready to get an 8x10 camera; take
the plunge. This is the format that Edward Weston used his entire life, to
great success. Stephen Shore tells me that it is the format of choice, and that
4x5 is for students. Joel Sternfeld tells me that it will ruin my life. Thus
warned I picked up a beautiful 1951 Deardorff at
Photo Habitat in Manhattan (same place I bought the 4x5). I
plan on shooting B&amp;W with it for now, and contact print on Azo paper.

<li><b>November 10th 2005</b><i> Brooklyn, NY,</i> Continuing with the buying
spree I bought a beautiful used Hasselblad outfit from KEH. Another camera that I had wanted for a long
time and is now significantly cheaper on the used market as the pros go
digital. Good for me.

<li><b>March 25th 2006</b><i> Brooklyn, NY,</i> Offered one of the four
photography slots at the 
Visual Arts Program of Columbia University School of the Arts
MFA program. I'm off to grad school ! Starting this fall and graduating in
2008.

<li><b>September 2006&mdash;May 2008</b><i> Columbia University,</i> two
intensive years of graduate school. Spend 7 days a week, 12 to 16 hours a day
on campus. amazing.</li>

<li><b>May 21st 2008</b><i> Columbia University,</i> receive my Master of Fine
Arts Degree from Columbia University.</li>

<li><b>May 27th 2008</b><i> Columbia University,</i> Start teaching Photo I
class at Columbia during the summer session. Continue teaching there 
for the next 11 years.</li>
