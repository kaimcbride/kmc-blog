### Meh 
Once again, starting over with a new website concept. I've had this domain since July of 2002, but I can't remember when I first created
a website that used it. Perhaps in 2006 when I was in 
grad school at Columbia University and no longer felt like I could get away with my existing domain: *mumbleBunnies.org*. After all, I was
on my way to becoming a 'Master'. 

The site has always been a glorified portfolio. Groups of photographs arranged by project. Maybe some 'news' that never got updated (not enough news?). 

Then Instagram came along and I started posting new things there instead of updating this website. It was stale. There were no photographs
on the site newer than when I moved to New Mexico six years ago. That can't be right. 

### Fresh Start
What I'm thinking for this revamp. 
* treat it as a blog: photographs and writing
* have some portfolio kind of element here (somehow) so that people have a sense of my work
* link to other people's work
* post new photographs often
* link to bluesky account
* see what happens
