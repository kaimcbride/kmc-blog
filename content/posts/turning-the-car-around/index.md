### Worth Turning Around?
I think every photographer can relate to this scenario. You're driving along and spot 
something up ahead that looks intriguing. You split your attention between the road and
the rapidly approaching scene. Do I want to make a photograph of this? While you are
still having these thoughts you come along side it and then it is only visible through
stolen glances in the mirrors. At highway speed this all happens within a few seconds. 
You already missed the chance to stop and pull over. Now, do 
you turn around and go back?

### The Debate
Unless you are "out photographing", in which case of course you turn around and go back
since that is the whole reason you are out driving around in the first place, you start
to have a quick debate:
* Was it really that interesting?
* How easy would it be to go back?
* If I do go back, is there going to be a spot to pull off the road?
* Should I just continue on my way and get to my non-photography destination?
* I'll have to drive further down the road to find a spot to make a u-turn, then backtrack, and backtrack again... 
* Don't be a schmuck, go back already
* I could stop next time I'm coming through. Light might be better...

I believe the right answer is to always go back. Even if, after further assessment, it winds up not being that
interesting. Or, horror of horrors, the resulting photograph isn't compelling. At least you won't arrive at your
destination with a pang of regret. Even though I have this conviction, I somehow still have
the debate. Even though I know that when I get back in the car after making the photographs I'll be
satisfied with myself for turning around and 'being a photographer' for a few minutes. It's kind
of like that resistance to getting out of bed and exercising. We know. We know, but do we act? 

Both of these photographs were made on New Mexico Highway 41 while driving back from
Moriarty to home. The camera was out and sitting on the passenger seat. I wasn't out
photographing; I was fetching a cast iron radiator we bought at an antique store. 
I had plenty of time before my next obligation and so the debate lasted only a few
seconds. Still, I did have to turn around. Why didn't I just stop before going past it?
Maybe next time?
